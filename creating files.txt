>> mkdir Playground
>> cd .\Playground\
>> echo $null >> slide.py 

Note: To use the above to create a python file, you have to do the following in order to syntax error when running python files:
1. In file, go to File > Save with Encoding > select UTF-8 

Another option:
>>New-Item -ItemType file nameOfFile.py

Another option:
Create the py file by going to new file of the directory > type nameOfFile.py (ensure the extension .py is added)

Best Option:
Creating a temporary function. It will create a temporary function (temp meaning while that instance of PowerShell is open) that allow you to type: touch nameOfFile.py

>> function touch {New-Item -ItemType File -Name ($args[0])}
>> touch nameOfFile.py

To make this a "permanent" change it just needs to be added to the PowerShell profile at:

1. C:\Users\USERNAMEWEHRE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Mircrosoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1

Note that you need to alter the above path to reflect your actual username.

First run:
2. Test-Path $profile

to check if a profile file already exist.

If True, then navigate to the above location and copy and paste in the function line. Restart Powershell.

If False, then enter the below command to create a new empty profile file: (ONLY DO IF NO IS FOUND AS THE -force FLAG WILL OVERWRITE ANY EXISTING PROFILE)
(Optional if false) 3. New-Item -Path $Profile -Type File -force

At this point navigate to the above profile location and paste in the function (this one without the double qoutes: "function touch {New-Item -ItemType File -Name ($args[0])}").
Restart Powershell. You can now type touch to create new empty files encoded with UTF-8.
