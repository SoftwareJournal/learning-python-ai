Navigating Absolutely
1. The command "cd" (change directory) followed by the absolute path of the folder will navigate you directly there 
>> cd C:\User (as an example)

Navigating Relatively
2. The dot "." stands for current directory, and dot-dot ".." for parent directory. This allows for relative navigation:
>> cd .. (as an example)

example
>> ls
>> cd .\somestuff\inchild\folderdirectory
>> cd ..\goback\to\parentdirectory
>> clear

3. The backlash "cd \" stands for going back to root directory
